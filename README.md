## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with the `start_ocean.sh` script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh
```

This will bring up the `stable` versions of all components, referring to their respective `master` branches.

To get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches, pass the argument `--latest`:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Script Options

The `start_ocean.sh` script provides the following options:

Option | Description
---    | ---
`--latest` | Get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches.
`--no-pleuston` | Start up Ocean without an instance of `pleuston`. Helpful for development on `pleuston`.
`--local-secret-store` | Runs a local parity POA node and Secret Store instead of ganache-cli.
`--reuse-database` | Start up Ocean and reuse the Database from ganache. Helpful for development.
`--testnet-parity-node` | Start up a parity client connected to Ocean testnet.
`--kovan-parity-node` | Start up a parity client connected to Kovan testnet.

For example, if you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

then the main/default [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) will be used, so the following Docker images will all be started:

- mongo:3.6
- oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts:latest
- oceanprotocol/aquarius:latest
- oceanprotocol/brizo:latest
- oceanprotocol/pleuston:latest

To see what ports each of those listens on, read [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Note that `keeper-contracts` runs a local Ganache node (not a local Parity Ethereum POA node).

If you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --no-pleuston
```

then [docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml](docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml) will be used, so these images will be started:

- mongo:3.6
- oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts:stable
- oceanprotocol/aquarius:stable
- oceanprotocol/brizo:stable

If you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest --local-secret-store
```

then [docker-compose-local-secret-store.yml](docker-compose-local-secret-store.yml) will be used. Note that it _doesn't_ start Pleuston, and it _does_ start a Parity Secret Store. The images that are started would be:

- mongo:3.6
- oceanprotocol/parity-ethereum:master (for parity client)
- oceanprotocol/parity-ethereum:master (for secret store)
- nginx:alpine (for secret store cluster)
- oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts:latest
- oceanprotocol/aquarius:latest
- oceanprotocol/brizo:latest

If you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest --no-pleuston --local-secret-store
```

then the last-selected Docker Compose file will be used, i.e. the one selected by `--local-secret-store`: [docker-compose-local-secret-store.yml](docker-compose-local-secret-store.yml).

Finally, if you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --testnet-parity-node
```

then `docker-compose-only-parity.yml` Docker Compose file will be used. It will start only one container (`oceanprotocol/parity-ethereum:master`) that will connect to the Ocean testnet network. The parity client is configure to allow connections with the RPC interface. With this option, you must place in `./parity/ocean-network/account.json` your account json and in `./parity/ocean-network/password` a file with the account passsword (default locations). Also you must export the variable `UNLOCK_ADDRESS` with the account address of this account. For example:

```bash
export UNLOCK_ADDRESS="0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e"
```

Or if you do:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --kovan-parity-node
```

then `docker-compose-only-parity.yml` Docker Compose file will be used. It will start only one container (`oceanprotocol/parity-ethereum:master`) that will connect to the Kovan testnet network. The parity client is configure to allow connections with the RPC interface. With this option, you must place in `./parity/kovan/account.json` your account json and in `./parity/kovan/password` a file with the account passsword (default locations). Also you must export the variable `UNLOCK_ADDRESS` with the account address of this account. For example:

```bash
export UNLOCK_ADDRESS="0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e"
```

### Parity Client Accounts

If you run the `start_ocean.sh` script with the `--local-secret-store` option, you will have available a Parity Client instance with the following accounts enabled:

Account | Password | Balance
--------|----------|--------
0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e | node0 | 10000000111000111000111000
0x068ed00cf0441e4829d9784fcbe7b9e26d4bd8d0 | secret | 100000000
0xa99d43d86a0758d5632313b8fa3972b6088a21bb | secret | 100000000

### Environment Variables

The `start_ocean.sh` script and `.env` file sets defaults for the following environment variables but you can use these in combination with the Docker Compose files for further customization, e.g.:

```bash
export REUSE_DATABASE="true"
docker-compose --project-name=ocean -f docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml up
```

Variable | Description
---      | ---
`REUSE_DATABASE` | The keeper-contracts component runs with ganache by default and every run will produce and deploy new instances of the keeper contracts. Ganache can be run with a specific database path by setting the env var `REUSE_DATABASE` to `"true"`. By default, the ganache database will be setup in the cwd.
`DEPLOY_CONTRACTS` | skip deploying smart contracts by setting this to `"false"`, in this case `REUSE_DATABASE` should be set to `"true"` in the previous run when using ganache
`KEEPER_NETWORK_NAME` | set to one of `"ganache"` (default), `"kovan"`, or `"ocean_poa_net_local"`
`ARTIFACTS_FOLDER` | this is where the deployed smart contracts abi files will be available. This can be pointed at any path you like.
`UNLOCK_ADDRESS` | Account address to unlock when running `--testnet-parity-node` or `--kovan-parity-node`
