## Disclaimer

Current implementation is an **alpha version**, so you can expect running into problems. The current implementation only support assets stored in Microsoft Azure storage.

## Get Started

For local development you can use Docker & Docker Compose. To do that you need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Docker

The most simple way to get started is with Docker compose:

```bash
docker-compose --project-name=ocean up
```

This will give you a local instance of Ocean Protocol.

After getting everything running, you could open the browser and access the **Pleuston Frontend** application:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Running options

This repository provides an script with different options to facilitate the execution of different setups:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh
```

By default the script starts Ganache and deploy the keeper-contracts there. If you want to use a **Parity Client** and **Secret Store** running in local, you can use the option `--local-parity-node`.
```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest --no-pleuston --local-parity-node
```

If you need an account with balance in that parity client, you can use the following:

```
parity.address="0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e"
parity.password="node0"
```

## Ocean components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* **Pleuston** frontend application. Listening on port **3000**.
* **Aquarius**. Listening on port **5000**.
* **Brizo**. Listening on port **8030**.
* **Keeper contracts**. Listening on port **8545**.
* **MongoDB**. Listening on port **27017**.
* **Secret Store**. Listening on port **12001**.
